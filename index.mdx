# What is it?

<Quote author="Raquel Moss" url="https://egghead.io/articles/what-is-state-why-do-i-need-to-manage-it">
State management makes the <strong>state of your app</strong> tangible in the form of a <strong>data structure</strong> that you can read from and write to. It makes your ‘invisible’ state clearly visible for you <strong>to work</strong> with.
</Quote>

# When do I need it?

- UI **components** that have dependencies (shared state)
- **SPAs/PWAs** (React, Vue, Angular, ...)
- **mobile** apps (React Native, Flutter, ...)

# Redux (2015)

Three principles
- Single source of truth (= one store)
- State is read-only (= only way to change by emitting actions)
- Changes are made with pure functions (pure reducers)
